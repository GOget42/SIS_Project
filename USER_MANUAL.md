# Student Information System User Manual

Welcome! This project is a Svelte based Student Information System that uses Supabase for authentication and data storage. This guide explains how to set up the application and describes the main features available to users.

## 1. Installation

1. Install Node.js (version 18 or later is recommended).
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create an `.env` file in the project root with your Supabase credentials. At minimum, define:
   ```bash
   PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
   PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
   ```
   If you use Supabase Edge Functions, also provide the service role key:
   ```bash
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
   ```

## 2. Development workflow

Start a development server with hot reloading:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Visit `http://localhost:5173` in your browser to view the app. Any code changes will reload automatically.

Run unit tests with:
```bash
npm test
```
Lint and format the project using:
```bash
npm run lint
npm run format
```

## 3. Building for production

Create an optimized production build:
```bash
npm run build
```
Preview the build locally:
```bash
npm run preview
```
Deploy the build output with a supported SvelteKit adapter for your target environment.

## 4. Basic usage

### Sign Up
1. Navigate to `/signup`.
2. Fill in your name, email, password and select a role (student, instructor or admin).
3. Submit the form to create your account.

### Login
1. Navigate to `/login`.
2. Enter your email and password, then press **Log In**.
3. On success you will be redirected to `/private/home`.

### Logout
Visit `/logout` to end your session and return to the login screen.

## 5. Role specific features

- **Students** can view their enrolled courses, assignment grades and progress charts.
- **Instructors** can see teaching courses and charts about student enrollment and assignments.
- **Admins** can manage courses and users through the staff and students pages, including creating new student accounts.

Navigate through the private routes under `/private/*` to access functionality according to your role.

## 6. Troubleshooting

- If the application cannot connect to Supabase, verify the values in your `.env` file.
- Check the terminal running `npm run dev` for error messages.
- When creating users through the admin pages, ensure your loggedâ€‘in account has the admin role so the Supabase functions can authorize the request.
